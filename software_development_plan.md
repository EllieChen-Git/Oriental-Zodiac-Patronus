# Software Development Plan –  Oriental Zodiac Patronus

### <u>Statement of Purpose and Scope</u>
    The purpose of Oriental Zodiac Patronus is to promote the idea of Chinese zodiac animals to users who either are not familiar with or have never heard of the Chinese horoscopes. This application also serves as a fun and interactive game for people to play around with their Chinese zodiac animals. 

    The first option ‘Zodiac Animal Test’ provided by Oriental Zodiac Patronus is that users can check their Chinese zodiac animals by simply entering their birth years. After receiving the information from users, this CLI application will show users their current age and a brief description of their zodiac animals. The second option is ‘Animal Compatibility Test’, where users can use their zodiac animals as a reference to find out their animal compatibility, i.e. their best matches and major conflict. The third option ‘Luck Prediction in 2020: Tai Sui Test’ serves as an oriental fortune teller. With this, users are able to use their zodiac animals to predict their luck in 2020, based on a Taoist concept ‘Tai Sui’ from the antient China. 

    For users who already know their Chinese zodiac animals, this terminal application offers the flexibility to skip the first option and go straight to Zodiac Animal Compatibility and Luck Prediction in 2020. Oriental Zodiac Patronus allows users to play games again and again until they decide to exit the program. In this case,  users can also use it to work out their family’s and friends’ Chinese zodiac animals.

    The target audience for this application are: 
        •	Zodiac fans who rely on zodiac signs interpretation in daily life, but would like to try out something other than the mainstream Western horoscopes.
        •	People who are interested in Chinese culture and would like to learn more in a fun and interactive way.
        •	People who would like to introduce the concept of Chinese zodiac animals to people around them, where this application can be used as an excellent demonstration.

    This terminal application was written in Ruby and incorporated with a Ruby Gem ‘Colorize’ to display text in colours other than the regular white text CLI commands.
